Snippets: https://github.com/candidmetrics/ember-module-snippets/blob/master/snippets/snippets.json

Features:

- NOTE: The prefix to trigger these snippets has changed from E. to E: due to changes to the way VSCode deals with the &quot;.&quot; character.
- All of these snippets are preceded by a E: (E-colon)
- Where you might have in the past said Ember.get, with ember-module-snippets you can type E:get followed by ctrl-space to get these artisanal, grass-fed, snippets for Ember.js. Fuzzy matches work as expected (E:bj brings up Ember.Object, etc).
- The  [Ember.js Module Unification](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0143-module-unification.md) project is an important precursor to unlocking a good bit of future functionality.
- The data for these snippets is based on:  [https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-rfc176-data](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-rfc176-data)
- And the raw json version:  [https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-rfc176-data/blob/master/mappings.json](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-rfc176-data/blob/master/mappings.json)
